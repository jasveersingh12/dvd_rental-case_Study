Here are some beginner-to-advanced SQL questions and code  based on the typical schema of the `dvdrental` database:

### **Beginner Level**
1. **Basic SELECT Queries:**
   - Retrieve the first 10 rows from the `customers` table.
     select * from customer 
     group by customer_id 
     limit 10;

   - Display the names and email addresses of all customers.
      select first_name, last_name, email from customer

2. **Filtering Data:**
   - Find all customers from a specific city (e.g., "San Francisco")
      select first_name, last_name, email, city
      from customer
      join address on customer.address_id = address.address_id
      join city on city.city_id = address.city_id
      where city ilike 'san francisco%'

- List all films with a rental rate greater than $2.99.
    select title, rental_rate from film
    where rental_rate >2.99

3. **Sorting Data:**
   - Display the names of all films sorted alphabetically.
    select title from film
    order by title asc
    
   - List the top 5 most expensive films based on their rental rate.
    select title,rental_rate from film
    where rental_rate >2.99
    limit 5

4. **Simple Aggregations:**
   - Count the total number of customers in the database.
   - Find the average rental rate of films.

### **Intermediate Level**
1. **Joins:**
   - Retrieve the names of customers and the titles of the films they rented.
   - Find the payment details for each customer, including their name and the amount paid.

2. **Group By and Aggregations:**
   - Calculate the total revenue generated by each film.
   - List the total number of rentals per customer.

3. **Subqueries:**
   - Find the names of customers who rented the most expensive film.
   - Retrieve the details of films that have never been rented.

4. **Date Functions:**
   - Find the rentals made in the last 30 days.
   - Calculate the total revenue generated in a specific month (e.g., January 2023).

### **Advanced Level**
1. **Window Functions:**
   - Rank films based on their rental count.
   - Calculate the cumulative revenue for each customer.

2. **Complex Joins:**
   - Find the total revenue generated by each store.
   - Retrieve the details of staff members and the number of rentals they processed.

3. **Views:**
   - Create a view that shows customer names, the films they rented, and the rental duration.
   - Develop a view that displays the total revenue by category.

4. **Stored Procedures:**
   - Write a stored procedure to calculate the total revenue for a given date range.
   - Create a procedure to identify inactive customers (e.g., those who havenâ€™t rented in the last 6 months).

5. **Triggers:**
   - Create a trigger to automatically update the inventory status when a film is rented.
   - Write a trigger to log rental transactions into an audit table.

6. **Optimization:**
   - Analyze and optimize a query that retrieves all films rented by a specific customer.
   - Identify and add appropriate indexes to improve query performance.

### **Project Ideas**
- **Customer Retention Analysis:** Identify customers who haven't rented a film in the last year.
- **Top Performers Dashboard:** Show the top 10 most-rented films, total revenue by category, and staff performance metrics.
- **Profit Analysis:** Calculate the profitability of films based on their rental rates and frequency of rentals.
